1. Question to be Answered
  ● How much of the trash produced at SCU is sorted properly? The motivation for the question is the pre-class survey and curiosity about how waste is sorted at SCU.
2. Data Processing
● Categorise each row into two categories - Sorted & Not sorted.
● The waste is sorted correctly if waste is dropped in the correct bin, and the waste is not sorted
correctly if garbage is dropped in the wrong bin.
● Food Waste in Compost is considered sorted correctly, and the rest of the food waste is not.
● Dropped rows which had the label “Reusables”.
3. Findings
● 731.4 lbs of total waste are correctly sorted (~63%), and 431.4 lbs are not (~37%).

4. Design
● I designed a stacked bar chart because it was the best way to visualise the findings and the design idea.
● I find most charts boring; they convey information but don't grab your attention. This chart was designed to grab attention and also convey information.
● The chart is designed as a dumpster and waste bins to represent the total trash collected from all streams and the waste collected in each stream at SCU, respectively.
● Colour: The charts are coloured based on the stream labels: green for compost, blue for recycling and black for landfill.
● Colour coding the bar charts based on the waste label makes it easier to find the desired waste stream when compared to a chart with the same colour scheme for all the streams (eliminates the need for looking at the legend when you can identify the stream by color).
● The “Not Sorted” part of the chart is greyed out; grey contrasts with all the other colours.
● Size: The size of the chart was designed to best represent a waste bin without making the bin
look elongated and thin.
● Waste stream icons have been added for more visibility.
